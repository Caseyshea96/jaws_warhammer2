# Local speech protocol v1

The game writes UTF-8 newline-delimited JSON to `%LOCALAPPDATA%/JawsWarhammer2/bridge.jsonl`, falling back to `jaws_access.jsonl` in the game working directory. The companion reads local output only; there is no command return channel or replacement multiplayer transport.

Records contain `version` (1), `session`, positive increasing `sequence`, `context` (frontend/campaign/battle), `generation`, `kind` (speech/focus/result/hello/context/error/hover), and `text`. Sessions use local context/time identity without gameplay RNG. Generation changes invalidate pending UI activation. Input is handled through native game shortcuts/UI clicks and Windows keyboard mouse controls.

The Lua writer caps text at 6000 bytes and rotates output at 2 MiB. The reader skips existing history on startup, retains incomplete UTF-8 records, detects truncation/replacement, reads at most 64 KiB per poll and rejects lines beyond 32 KiB. The parser validates envelopes, drops duplicate sequences and retired sessions, and bounds retired-session memory. Fresh game input is required after starting the companion.

The development companion combines primary messages in arrival order per polling batch, collapsing only consecutive focus records. Each batch is bounded to 16 records / 8000 text characters, with an explicit overflow announcement and diagnostic entry. Older companion versions reject the new focus/result kinds, so deploy matching mod and companion versions. This does not yet provide completion-aware speech scheduling across polls; optional hover speech is off by default and yields to primary messages. Repeat, stop and mute are companion-local. Input dispatch is not proof of gameplay success; activation is never automatically retried.

See `tests/speech_batch_tests.ps1`, `tests/bridge_tests.ps1` and `tests/check_access.py` for automated coverage. Actual game file permissions, JAWS COM speech and co-op operation still require live testing.
